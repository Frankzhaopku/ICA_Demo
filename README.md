# ICA Demo

Demo of ICA in image separation written in MATLAB.

Just run ICA.m to see the results, you can change the `imread` parameter to read different pic files and change mix matrix `A` to see the difference.

For an online video lesson, please refer: [Youtube lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e4SN4TWlgY).

For the original paper of ICA, please refer: [paper](ICA_Tutorial.pdf).

If you use `pic1.jpg` and `pic2.jpg` and the mix matrix is [0.8 0.2; 0.2 0.8], then the result will be:

![result1](result1.jpg)

If you use `pic3.jpg` and `pic4.jpg` and the mix matrix is [0.8 0.2; 0.2 0.8], then the result will be:

![result2](result2.jpg)

If you use `pic4.jpg` and `pic5.jpg` and the mix matrix is [0.8 0.2; 0.2 0.8], then the result will be:

![result3](result3.jpg)

Have fun.
